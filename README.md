# Gujarati NLP – Low-Resource Sentiment Analysis

This project studies text classification under low-resource conditions using Gujarati movie reviews.

## Motivation
Gujarati is underrepresented in NLP research despite its large speaker base.

## Approach
We compare a classical TF-IDF baseline with multilingual transformer models to evaluate data-efficient learning.

## Models
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Multilingual Transformer (XLM-R / DistilBERT)

## Results
Transformer models outperform classical baselines under low-resource constraints.

## Notes
Training was performed under limited computational resources.
